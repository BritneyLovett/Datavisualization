## Ford GoBike Data Exploration
## by Britney Lovett


## Dataset

> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. To wrangle the data I started with downloading the dataset via a csv file. I uploaded it to a pandas dataframe and then began my assessment. Looking at a snippet of the data along with datatypes and statistics gave me a picture of the type of information housed within the dataset. I could see there were 16 columns and 183,412 rows. Throughout the wrangling I realized there was quite a bit of clean up to do with the datatypes and null values. After I obtained the data, assessed its state, cleaned the data I then analyzed the data. 


## Summary of Findings

> Throughout the analysis process I started with basic single variable analysis. I ran calculations on the distributions of age to see how spread out the ages of the users. I also looked at the breakdown by gender, and user type. I looked at the starting and end locations to see trends in where rentals start and stop. Perhaps these areas are the "hot spots" around San Francisco. Another part of the analysis was looking at the duration length. How long do the durations last? These are some of the ways in which I analyzed the dataset. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The Ford GoBike dataset revealed that males were more likely to rent a bike than females. More interesting, females had a longer average duration than males. Both genders start and end at the same station points indicating 2 popular areas in San Francisco. The younger the group the more likely they are to rent the bikes. The average range of renters are from 20s to late 30s. Customers are more likely to have a longer trip duration than subscribers maybe indicating sightseeing a little while longer. There is more in this dataset to explore, but these are several key insights uncovered during this analysis.
